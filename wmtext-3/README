Description
-----------
wmtext is a dock application that displays the output of a shell command.

The background and text colours can be changed according to patterns found in
the command output.

Usage
-----
wmtext [-i cmd_update_interval_in_s]
  [-b default_background_colour] [-f default_foreground_colour]
  [-font font_name]
  [-a regular_expression background_colour foreground_colour]...
  'command args...'

-i N      sets to N seconds the time between command executions
-b C      sets the default background colour to C
-f C      sets the default foreground (text) colour to C
-font fn  sets the font to fn
-a r b f  sets an `alert': if the regular expression r is found in the output,
          changes background (resp. foreground) colours to b (resp. f )

Several alerts can be set. Regular expressions are tried in the same order as
they were specified on the command line. The first match determines the
colours to be used. If no match is found, the default colours are used. If the
default colours are not specified, black will be used for background, white for
the foreground.

Colours can be specified as X colour names (found in rgb.txt, e.g.
'misty rose') or as hexadecimal RGB triplets (e.g. '#45AF23').

Examples
--------
Display the date:
  ./wmtext scripts/date.sh

Use a large font:
  ./wmtext -font "-*-helvetica-*-r-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*" "date +%S"

Display the ACPI state of the first battery, with varying colours depending on
whether it is charging, discharging, under 10% charge or in another state:
  ./wmtext \
    -a 'Charging|Unknown' darkgreen white \
    -a '[^0-9][0-9]\.[0-9]%' red white \
    -a Discharging navyblue white \
    scripts/acpi_battery
